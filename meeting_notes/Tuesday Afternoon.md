## Organization of Ideas 

Layers 
* Biomass (Data set GEDI L4B @ 25m)
* Management (Data set Landfire, CFRI)
* Beetle Kill density/fire polygon (data set Disturbance stack and Landfire)
* Elevation/Species distribution (data set FIA, SRTM 800m)
- Only considering montane between 1662m to 2838m

### End Goal 
Map layered with above considerations with the areas of highest concern highlighted. Where to manage when resources are limited. 

#### considerations 
* Future additions: adding carbon stock layer
