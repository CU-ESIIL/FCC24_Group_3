# Tuesday AM "Raw" Brainstorming Question NOtes

* Haymen fire - restoration, regeneration hasn’t happened - basically no trees - they are currently doing active planting 

* 2002- lower Jefferson County  (CO Springs), ponderosa pine dominant, higher elevations are lodge pole pines 

* High density because of suppression 

* Huge extra amount of trees 

* We are at a carbon surplus - because its stocked so heavily

* With great disturbance - we aren’t starting from a baseline of healthy forest 

* Where do we take this data and put it on the ground? Forest management side 

* When we do forest management - we take fuels away, what does that have to do with carbon sinkage 
Getting back to historical sinkage ? 

* Thinning - different agencies are doing it at different capacities 

* Resilient or resistance  

* Logging equipment, road building 

* What does restoration mean? Mixture of different habitats and trees, Restoration looks different post wildfire 

Question refinement 

* Pick area within CO 
    * A forest that has seen restoration projects, seen high severity wildfire (central north CO) 

* Biogeography 

* Does severity impact restoration rates? 

* Thinning, but leaving mother tree 

* There’s a point at which burning can help, and then a decline when its too high severity

* The seeds have to meet mineral soil to succeed and grow 

* Lodgepole pine - low severity helps them disperse 

* Soil 

* CA: Shrub and conifer dynamics 

* Health of forest understory 

* Lodgepole pine is supposed to be a higher elevation species,  high mortality rate but every 100 years 

* Fire regime changed 

* Lodgepole like to shade their understory, and the baby trees 

* Management strategies over the past 100 years 

* Cameron Peak Fire - going beyond forest service land, national park dealing with the same levels of density 

* Erosin under control 

* FIA with forest and state forest service 

* Tatum 

* Spent the last 2-3 on the ground with restoration projects 

* Larimer County area - agency doing science backed restoration, very up to date with the research to bring back ecosystem to level where ecosystem services are providing to resist catastrophic wildfire 

* Cameron Peak met a preventative restoration project and stopped - this is the whole goal 

* Catastrophic wildfire - runs 

* Distance between crowns is too large for fire to jump, creating a mosaic effect 

* Originally less trees in groups, meadows in between to keep tire on the ground 
  
* Want to look at satellite data, land fire 

* Landfire shows management and when it happened 

* Overlap later with fire 

* A question that touches on carbon 

* Plot level disturbance history 

* Can tell species based on evolution 


* Do fuel treatments have a positive or negative affect on carbon stores? 

* What kind of datasets do we have familiarity with? 
- GEDI - until 2016 
- FIA 1998- present (every plot not every year, West every 10 years, slower growth rates) 

* Would FIA ever survey the West faster than 10 years? 

* Can do tree level then biomass plot level 

* How pattern has changed due to process? 


* 5min individual time to come up with 1 question 

* Projecting into the future does not seem realistic into 2.5 days 

* State forest service data, CSU research projects 

* National parks - limited data collection ability, only 1 fire crew post Cameron Peak fire 


## Potential Questions Brainstorming 

* Inspired by Cameron Peak fire stopping at restoration + Sarah Hart’s question 
* Do fuel treatments have a positive or negative affect on carbon storage? 
* Impact in terms of carbon on different restoration techniques post fire? Cameron Peak 

### Questions about question 
* Does the landfire data have what we need about thinning treatments ? 


Data 
* Plot level (national forest service and state) then convert to carbon 
* Fire burn areas 
* Severity 

Impact 
* Discuss missing data + impacts 

Jiaming

- How do different restorations strategies impact carbon storage?
- How do carbon stores change in relation to fire frequency and severity 


Asha 
Biomass pattern change in response to topographic variation ? 

Tatum 
- How restoration impacts forest carbon? 
- Post fire focus - how does burn severity play a part in return of post burn carbon stores returning over time? 
    - High severity less overstory 



### Side discussions 

* Repeated burns- what we see in CA could be the future of CO

* Elevation plays the biggest part on what returns after 

* Lodgepole pine is coming back in high density 

* Fire regime time differences between CA and CO, slightly different species distribution 

* CA- drier forests that edge shrubs

* Bring in topographic data 


* CFRI - organization trying to push smaller agencies to establish permanent plots 


* Focus on Cameron Peak Fire 

* Forest management and fire burn severity 

* Post fire management - erosion control or tree planting, wood chip spreading - adds carbon to system to provide stabilization of soils 




## Question 

* What is the impact of different fuel treatments in terms of carbon, a Colorado case study with Cameron Peak Fire, and potentially other fires tbd


## Data
* AIF field plots
* Historical biomass,
* Biomass post fire 
* Fire burn data + polygons 
* Types of fuel treatment 


## Goal Impact 
* Show gaps in data availability- what other data would be really valuable 
* Importance of any and all fuel treatments 
* Longer term find areas where fuel reduction treatments would have the most need 
* Recommendation for management 
* Where are we putting are money 
* Policy making + decision making part 


### Future Work 
* Project under different systems how would it impact the carbon stories
