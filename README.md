## Management priority areas in response to biomass pattern driven by various disturbances

**Motivation of the Project**
Current Biomass pattern resulted by synergistic effect of changing ecological processes induced by rapid climate change and anthropogenic activities needs broad scale management activities to create a safer and sustianable forest. In case of Southern Rocky Mountain Ecoregion, where complex mountainous topography makes management activities very challenging, it is important to identify those areas that need management versus where it is fessible for management activities.

Our main focus to first quantify the potential biomass growth area, and the area with extreme disturbace impacts including insect and fire and then identify areas that requirement management versus where it is fessible to do so given the geographic challenges, i.e., slope and elevation.

## Project Objective

**To quantify and understand the high management priority areas based on current biomass pattern and topographic factors in the Southern Rocky Mountain Ecoregion.**

**Main variables and Data Source**
Biomass- Chloris Biomass
Growth Potential -Forest Inventory Analysis, FIA
Disturbance (wildfire and insect) over 50 acres occurring between 1999-2022: Disturbance Stack, Landfire
Management for fuels reduction over 40 acres including: Thinning, Harvest, Clearcut, Prescribed Fire, Mastication and other Mechanical: LandFire - Management 
Topographic Factors: SRTM 
Elevation: Montane (1662-2838) m asl 
Slope 0-40%
